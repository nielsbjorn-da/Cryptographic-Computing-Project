# Cryptographic-Computing-Project
A 2.5 ECTS point project about threshold wallet with BeDoza for secret sharing and ECDSA for signing protocol



## Notes
### Threshold Wallets:

- What is a threshold wallet that exactly?  


	Threshold wallet is just a wallet that uses threshold signatures. 

- What is the threshold?  


	In a two party protocol it is 1 out 2
	In general it is something you decide on yourself. 

- What do you suggest that we do?


	We could fake a wallet in a class/struct
	(If we are more ambitious we can get it working with an actual wallet with already existing code)
	(Der er nogle videoer pÃ¥ youtube fra nogle studerende, der har lavet noget tilsvarende har jeg set)

	1. Get bedoza to work in large fields
	2. Implement the ECDSA signing protocol. 


- What scheme do we use for secret sharing?  


	Just bedoza

Section 4 is an important section of our project.
